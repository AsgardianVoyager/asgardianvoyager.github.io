# My project - the Battleships game
The goal of the project was creating a variation of the popular battleships game. We used C programming language. This project was part of our work during an univeristy course "NarzÄ™dzia informatyczne" (IT tools). During our cooperation we succeeded in developing the project to satisfactory stage as a team. We hope that You will enjoy playing our game ðŸ™‚
